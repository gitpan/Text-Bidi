          Text::Bidi::Constants

2.03      2013-09-20 12:09:39 Asia/Jerusalem
        * More changes to Makefile.PL
2.02    12.09.2013
        Fixed Makefile.PL
        
2.01    11.09.2013
        * Refactored Text::Bidi::Array::* to have a common base class 
          Text::Bidi::Array
        * Significantly improved the documentation of Text::Bidi::Array*
        * Fixed a bug in Text::Bidi::Array::Long --- now returns the correct 
          size
        * Added loading tests for Text::Bidi::Array*
        * Removed "no warnings 'experimental'", since this caused tests to 
          fail on older versions of perl.
        * Added information about the bidi extension for urxvt to the README 
          file
2.00    10.09.2013
        Almost completely rewritten, mostly due to the changes in libfribidi.  
        The interface has changed as well, so this version is incompatible 
        with the previous ones.

0.04    07.02.2008
        * Changed the build system to use ExtUtils::PkgConfig (if available), 
          to find the correct compilation flags (this is required since the 
          new version of libfribidi may need glib to build.)

0.03    18.01.2007
        * The PUSH macros caused some weird results, replaced with my own 
          macros
        * Apparently, Newx did not exist before 5.8.8, defined it if does not 
          exist

0.02    17.01.2007
        * Fixed memory leak in remove_bidi_marks when called with two 
          arguments
        * Fixed bug when calling log2vis with 2 arguments
        * Changed the typemaps to use more perlapi macros (XPUSH, etc.)

0.01    28.08.2006
        First version
