Text-Bidi

This is a perl interface to the libfribidi library that implements the 
Unicode bidi algorithm. The bidi algorithm is a specification for displaying 
text that consists of both left-to-right and right-to-left written languages.

The package was complete reimplemented in version 2.0, and the interface is 
incompatible with older versions.

The package also includes an extension for the urxvt (rxvt-unicode) terminal 
to display bidi text correctly. It is located in misc/bidi.

PREREQUISITES

The GNU fribidi library should be installed prior to installing this module.  
It is available from http://fribidi.org .

To re-build the interface files, swig is required. However, the module comes 
with these files, so swig is not necessary. Swig is available at 
http://www.swig.org . Version 2.0.10 was used to build the interface files.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

As mentioned above, fribidi should already be installed.

To install the extension for urxvt, simply put it in the urxvt's search path 
for perl extensions, and add it to the perl-ext-common resource. See 
urxvtperl(1) for details.
