Text-Bidi

This is a perl interface to the libfribidi library that implements the 
Unicode bidi algorithm. The bidi algorithm is a specification for displaying 
text that consists of both left-to-right and right-to-left written languages.

PREREQUISITES

The fribidi library should be installed prior to installing this module. It 
is available from http://fribidi.org . The module was tested with version 
0.10.7 of the library.

To re-build the interface files, swig is required. However, the module comes 
with these files, so swig is not necessary. Swig is available at 
http://www.swig.org . Version 1.3.31 was used to build the interface files.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

As mentioned above, fribidi should be installed. Note that most of the tests  
during 'make test' will probably fail, because of (apparently) a bug in 
libfribidi, as described in the pod.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the perldoc 
command.
